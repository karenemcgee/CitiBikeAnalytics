## Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

Acting as a lead data analyst for the company, I was tasked with generating regular reports for the city as it looks to publicize and improve the program. My goal was to implement dashboards and sophisticated reporting processes to answer the questions of the many non-data-analytic stakeholders such as city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City departments. 

## Tasks

* Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs for Jersey City and identify unexpected phenomena.
* Design several visualizations for each discovered phenomena.
* Use the visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
* Create a static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
* Compose a write-up unveiling any trends that were noticed during the analysis.
* Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
